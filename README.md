# ⛽ Gas Demand Predictor

AI-powered LPG gas demand prediction and auto-refill suggestion system for Sri Lanka.

## Features

- 🏠 **Household Prediction** — Predicts exact gas depletion date based on usage habits
- 📊 **Station Forecasting** — 7-day demand forecast for gas station operators
- 🤖 **Agentic Architecture** — 3 AI agents (Usage, Weather, Demand) + Orchestrator
- 🔊 **Voice Alerts** — Browser-based voice notifications
- 📧 **Email Alerts** — Automatic email when gas is running low
- 📱 **Web Dashboard** — React frontend with charts and analytics

## ML Models

| Model | Algorithm | Purpose | MAE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Household Depletion | Random Forest | Predict days until gas runs out | ~15 days |
| Station Demand | Gradient Boosting | 7-day cylinder sales forecast | ~20 cylinders |
| Weather Agent | Rule Engine | Adjust predictions by season | N/A |

## Dataset Sources

- `household_filtered.csv` — 877 household usage records (real survey data)
- `household_gas_data.csv` — 877 enriched household survey responses (real)
- `gas_station_survey.csv` — 55 gas station operator survey responses (real)
- `station_sales_synthetic.csv` — 5,475 daily sales records (synthetically generated from survey statistics)
